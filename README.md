# Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various features. The project is part of EcodeCamp internship task, applying data science and machine learning skills to a real-world dataset.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using features such as gender, age, family size, passenger class, and whether they were traveling alone.
## Features
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male or female)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **Family Size**: Total number of family members aboard, including the passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class)
- **IsAlone**: Boolean feature indicating if the passenger was traveling alone
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and model development
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating the machine learning model
## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook Titanic_Survival.ipynb to see the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.
## Results
The model has been evaluated using various accuracy metrics to ensure its reliability in predicting survival outcomes. Detailed results and analysis are available in the notebook.
